  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

        "The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him
        believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a king, a
        merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist."
      </p>

        "The boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal
        Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced
        everything he might have dreamed of."
        <br><br>
        "As he stood up shakily, and looked
        once more at the Pyramids. They seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed
        back, his heart bursting with joy. Because now he knew where his
        treasure was."
