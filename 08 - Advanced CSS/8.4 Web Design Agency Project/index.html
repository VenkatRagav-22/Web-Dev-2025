        <p class="card-text">
          I’m just a guy learning to trust the journey — figuring things out,
          falling forward, and growing through every step. I believe our dreams
          mean something, that nothing is random, and that what’s meant for us
          is already written. Right now, I’m becoming — learning web
          development, building confidence, and chasing something I can’t fully
          name yet… but I know it’s out there..
        </p>

          alt="Me with my bike"
        />
        <h2 class="card-title">We'll get along well if...</h2>
        <p>
          You're also someone who finds peace on long rides — somewhere around 7000rpm,
          everything just feels right. Into games, fitness, music that hits the
          soul, and creating things that mean something. Learning web dev,
          leveling up in life, and taking it one day (and one adventure) at a
          time.
